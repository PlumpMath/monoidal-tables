# monoidal-tables

Table generator and formatter

This package provides a module for easy generating of pretty tables. It 
features a couple renderers for textual output as well as for HTML.

Unlike other libraries for generating pretty tables, this module makes sure 
that it is impossible to mix up header names and actual values.

The table itself does not contain any data. It is merely a blueprint for 
turning a collection of data into an actual table. You create the blueprint 
by combining multiple columns.
It is heavily inspired (a knock off, actually) by yesod-tables, a brilliant 
Haskell library. Unlike its inspiration, it does not have  arious columns 
for different types, as that is pointless in Python. It does have better 
support for customization, though.


## Why the name

A monoid is a set with binary associative operation with neutral element. 
Tables as presented here exactly satisfy this condition. The empty table 
(with no columns) takes on the role of neutral element and concatenating is 
the desired operation.

## Example

```python
    from operator import itemgetter
    table = (integer('X', itemgetter('x')) +
             integer('Y', itemgetter('y')) +
             string('Name', itemgetter('name')))
    data = [
        {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'name': 'Origin'},
        {'x': 5, 'y': 5, 'name': 'Diagonal'},
        {'x': 2, 'y': 8, 'name': 'Up'},
    ]
    table.render(data, renderer=FancyRenderer)
```
